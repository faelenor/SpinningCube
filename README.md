# Spinning Cubes

## Physics - Constant torque

This method uses the "Constant Force" component to set a contant torque on the rigid body. Angular drag is used to stabilize the rotation to an acceptable speed.

## Physics - Initial angular velocity

This method sets an initial angular velocity on the rigid body via script. Angular drag is set to zero to make sure that the rotation won't stop.
