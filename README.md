# Spinning Cubes

## 1. Physics - Constant torque

This method uses the "Constant Force" component to set a contant torque on the rigid body. Angular drag is used to stabilize the rotation to an acceptable speed.

## 2. Physics - Initial angular velocity

This method sets an initial angular velocity on the rigid body via script. Angular drag is set to zero to make sure that the rotation won't stop.

## 3. Animated cube

We add a component "Animator" to a cube. This component plays an animation which modifies the cube's transform. This animation has been created via Unity's curve editor in the Animation Window.

## 4. Video player
We play a video on the near plane of the camera which represents a spinning cube.

## 5. Scripted rotation
In the update of a C# script attached to the cube we rotate the object.
